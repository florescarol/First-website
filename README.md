# First website
I'm learning how to program and applying what I learn to create a website of a fictional but very nice company using HTML, CSS and JS.

## Menu
There is a menu on the top of the screen. The name of the company is on the left. On the right, there are 4 options: "About us", "Our products", "FAQ" and "Contact us". The "About us" option is a hover dropdown menu with 2 options: "Our story" and "Our team". When you hover each item in the menu, the color changes.

## Welcome page
On the left, there is a picture from the employees working (it's from unsplash) and on the right there is a box talking about the very important mission of the company.

## About us
The "About us" section is divided in "Our story" and "Our team". They are both aligned with each other.

## In construction:
I'm still working on the "FAQ" and "Contact us" page. The page is not responsive yet.
